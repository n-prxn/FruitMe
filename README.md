# Fruit Me!

Developed by Unity in 5 days and Character Art by Piskel. This prototype is only for education only. I am developing the another bigger project so you can still donate to me. Thank you.

Story
A girl needs to find a job during her study, then she found the farm hiring a fruit keeper. Everything on this farm is normal except the fruits that keep falling down unstoppably.

Controller
Move Left - A or <-
Move Right - D or ->
Run - Shift (Watch out for stamina!!!)
Interact - E

Gamemode
Casual Mode (6 Level containing a tutorial)
Arcade Mode (Unlocked all fruits and items and 5 minutes gameplay)

How to play
1. Move your character held basket and catch the falling fruits.
2. Sell your caught fruits at table. Remember to avoid the fruits falling on your head.
3. Survive and keep doing this until the time runs out.
